Current considerations:

1.
For Windows firewall information, it seems that the INetFwMgr interface is not showing any open
ports... there is a GloballyOpenPorts property on the INetFwProfile object, but it's always empty.
I'm not exactly sure what "globally open" means here, so maybe that's actually expected behavior.
I looked into manually opening a port, but haven't yet found a simple way to do so. I found a stack
overflow post that uses the hardcoded GUID of the INetFwOpenPort COM object in order to instantiate 
a new port, to then pass to the INetFwOpenPorts.Add method, but that doesn't seem ideal.

However, I started digging into the FwPolicy2 object instead of the FwMgr, and it's giving me a 
lot more information. Each policy has a collection of INetFwRule objects, each with both a 
LocalPorts and RemotePorts property. 
I'm now reading tons of rules with open ports; network discovery, RPC, DHCP, etc... basically all of
the services you would expect to have ports open.


2.
It doesn't seem possible to be running the Windows Firewall at the same time as a 3rd party firewall.
Whenever activating a third party firewall, the windows firewall automatically becomes disabled. It 
also doesn't seem possible (or useful, or sensible) to be running multiple 3rd party firewalls. The current
implementation gathers a list of 3rd party firewalls, but I haven't successfully installed enough 
of them to see the list get larger than one item. Perhaps multiple firewalls will be registered in WMI, 
and they will all show up, but only one will be enabled. Further testing is required. Most of the freeware
firewalls I've found keep crashing my machine, but this could be a configuration issue, or just the result 
of trying to run multiple 3rd party firewalls together.

3.
Information in the WMI for 3rd party firewalls is limited, and not formatted very nicely. The displayName 
property is simple enough, but that's really the only thing that's useful. The only place to see the 
version number is on the executable path, assuming the vendor using such a naming schema. Dynamically 
pulling the version number out of the path is doable, but I anticipate issues with different vendors and 
different naming schemas. Also, the ProductState property is a 6 digit number, with no reference that I 
can find to explain what it corresponds to. Some research has shown that it might actually be vendor 
specific -- Each vendor gets to use its own 6 digit number however they please. Hopefully that's not true.
Trial and error can establish a correspondence relative to one specific product (i.e. changing the state 
in the products tools and seeing how the number changes). Perhaps installing all of the most commonly
used firewalls and manually determining what these numbers mean is the only way to go, but God I hope not..
